# DeepMA
Raman spectra contain abundant information from molecules but are difficult to analyze, especially for the mixtures. Therefore, a mixture analysis approach named Deep-learning-based Mixture Analysis (DeepMA) has been proposed in this study. Convolution Neural Network (CNN) models have been established to predict the presence of the components in the mixtures.
